# 🌍 Now What Project

**Now What** is a participatory democracy app with two parts:  

- **Now What (Input):** People share their voice daily through simple prompts.  
- **Here’s What (Output):** Collective results are instantly visible in real time, from local to global scales.  

The goal is to create a living feedback loop between people and society:  
**convergence (input) → emergence (output).**

## ✨ Principles
- **Truth-Aligned** — goals must respect reality.  
- **Participation for All** — every voice matters, every day.  
- **Privacy-First** — anonymous by default, no data exploitation.  
- **Transparent & Open** — processes, data, and results are visible.  
- **Non-Profit Stewardship** — never for private profit.
