# 🛠️ Now What Project — Roadmap  

This roadmap outlines the development path for the **Now What Project**, from concept to global adoption. It will evolve as the project grows.  

---

## 🌱 Phase 1: Foundations (Now)  
- [x] Draft Charter & Mission  
- [x] Create private GitHub repository  
- [x] Write README and documentation (`charter.md`, `roadmap.md`)  
- [ ] Define technical architecture (frontend, backend, database, visualization)  
- [ ] Build minimal prototype (MVP):  
  - Input: one daily question  
  - Output: one simple graph showing collective results  

---

## 🌳 Phase 2: Early Prototype (Pilot Stage)  
- [ ] Expand input types (sliders, multiple-choice, free text → anonymized)  
- [ ] Expand output visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, trendlines)  
- [ ] Implement privacy-first design (anonymous IDs, no tracking)  
- [ ] Build small community test (local group, ~100 users)  
- [ ] Collect feedback and refine user experience  

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: Scaling Up  
- [ ] Add fractal views (local → regional → global results)  
- [ ] Multilingual support  
- [ ] Mobile apps (React Native or Flutter)  
- [ ] Data export (open JSON/CSV for transparency)  
- [ ] Partnerships with NGOs, civic tech groups, and local governments  

---

## 🌌 Phase 4: Global Commons Transition  
- [ ] Independent audits of code, privacy, and data practices  
- [ ] Open source full platform (AGPLv3 for code, CC BY-SA for docs)  
- [ ] Establish open governance model (community council, voting on features)  
- [ ] Gradual hand-off from non-profit stewardship to a self-sustaining commons  
- [ ] Long-term support: documentation, community growth, partnerships  

---

## ✨ Guiding Idea  
The roadmap follows the natural loop of **convergence → emergence**:  

- **Convergence (Now What)**: people input their voices.  
- **Emergence (Here’s What)**: society sees the collective results.  

Each phase strengthens this loop, moving from prototype → pilot → global commons.
