# üåç Now What Project ‚Äî Charter  

## Our Mission  
To empower people everywhere with a living voice in society.  
We build open, transparent, and participatory tools that allow individuals to express their priorities and values, and to see those voices converge into shared goals that can guide communities, nations, and humanity as a whole.

## Our Vision  
A world where society is guided not by profit or power, but by shared goals aligned with truth.  
A world where every person can ask, *‚ÄúNow what?‚Äù* ‚Äî and see the collective answer, *‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what.‚Äù*  
A world where governments, organizations, and communities can listen to the living voice of the people.

- Build partnerships with communities, NGOs, and governments who wish to align with participatory democracy.  
- Prepare for eventual hand-off to a **global commons**, ensuring the platform becomes self-sustaining, community-governed, and open to all.
